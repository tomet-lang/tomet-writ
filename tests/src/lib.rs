//! Harness for the guard tests: locating a fixture and running `check`
//! over it.
//!
//! The expectation each test asserts against is written by hand, before
//! the code is run. A reference generated from current behavior asserts
//! only that the code does what the code does -- which is precisely the
//! difference between a rule and a guard that this tool exists to make.
//! So there is no `UPDATE_REF` here and no committed output to bless:
//! the wanted error is typed next to the case name, and the code is what
//! moves when the two disagree.
//!
//! Tests call the library rather than spawning the binary, because
//! `CARGO_BIN_EXE_*` is defined only for the package declaring the bin.
//! `Report::render` produces the exact text `main` prints, so what is
//! pinned is still the CLI's output.
