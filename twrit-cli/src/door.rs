//! A capability's allowed locations, and everyone else held to not having
//! it.
//!
//! The rule this exists for was written in prose and could not fail.
//! `tomet`'s `parser-purity` says file resolution is
//! "`tomet-semantics-resolver`'s job -- and the only place reading a
//! referenced file is allowed". Five crates touch `fs`. The sentence was
//! true when it was written, a second place appeared, and nothing
//! reported it, because a sentence has no way to notice.
//!
//! The difference from `pure` is the quantifier, and it is the whole
//! point. `pure` checks the crates it names: a crate that acquires an
//! ability without being named stays invisible to it. `door` names the
//! crates that *may* have the ability and checks every other member of
//! the workspace, so a new one arriving is what fails.
