//! Finding and reading `.writ.tmt` files.
//!
//! A writ is an author-owned normative file, one per directory, scoped to
//! that directory. This module locates them, resolves their names, and
//! reads each entry's declaration; deciding what a given rule *means* is
//! each guard's own job.
//!
//! Names are resolved through `tomet-load`, not matched by hand. A writ
//! declares `@kind(writ)`, so `@rule` and `@writ.rule` are two legal
//! spellings of the same element and `Bindings::classify` maps both to
//! `writ.rule`. This module used to match a bare `Sigil::Named` instead,
//! which found the first spelling and silently ignored the second --
//! and "silently ignored" means the rule stops being checked, which is
//! the exact failure this tool exists to prevent.
